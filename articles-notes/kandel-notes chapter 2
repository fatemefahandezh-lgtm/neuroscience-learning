## Day 8 – Review & Progress

### 📚 Study Summary
- Reviewed **Chapter 1** (Functional localization & core principles of neural science)
- Completed **Chapter 2** (Nerve Cells and Behavior)

### 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Structure of neurons (soma, dendrites, axon, synapse)
- Action potentials and membrane potential
- Synaptic transmission
- Reflex circuits (knee-jerk reflex)
- Neural networks and divergence/convergence
- Neural plasticity and its role in behavior

### 🎯 Main Insight
Behavior emerges from **networks of neurons**, not single cells.  
Brain plasticity allows modification of neural connections, enabling learning and partial recovery after injury.
