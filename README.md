## Day 1 – Nervous System Basics

Today I studied the basics of the nervous system using CrashCourse Anatomy & Physiology.

### What I learned:
- The nervous system has two main parts: Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
- The PNS is divided into afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) pathways
- The somatic nervous system controls voluntary movements
- The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions such as heart rate and breathing

### Neuron basics:
- A neuron consists of soma, dendrites, and an axon
- Dendrites receive signals and the axon transmits signals
- Types of neurons include multipolar, bipolar, and unipolar neurons
