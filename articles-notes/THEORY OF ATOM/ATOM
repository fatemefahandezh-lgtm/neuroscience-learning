In the article "A Theory of Magnitude" (ATOM), Vincent Walsh argues that our brains use a common system to process time, space, and quantity. Instead of these being three separate functions, he suggests they share a single "metric" used to help us interact with the world.
The Core Idea: ATOM
The author proposes that we have a generalized magnitude system primarily located in the parietal cortex of the brain. This system answers basic questions needed for action:
 * How far is an object? (Space) 
 * How long will an event last? (Time) 
 * How many items are there? (Quantity) 
Key Evidence
Walsh points to several types of evidence to support this theory:
 * Animal Behavior: Rats show very similar patterns when learning to discriminate between different numbers of tones and different lengths of time.
 * Brain Damage: Patients with damage to the parietal lobe often suffer from combined deficits in time, space, and number estimation, rather than losing just one.
 * Brain Imaging: Studies using fMRI and TMS show that the same areas in the right inferior parietal cortex are activated or disrupted during tasks involving all three magnitudes.
 * Development: Infants may be born with a "one-bit" system that treats all magnitudes the same. They learn to tell them apart as they grow by interacting with an environment where size, speed, and time are often linked.
Why are they connected?
The theory suggests these systems are linked because they are all "prothetic"—meaning they can be experienced as "more than" or "less than". We use this information to coordinate our movements, such as reaching for an object at the right speed or time.
New Predictions
Walsh predicts that effects previously only seen with numbers (like the SNARC effect, where small numbers are associated with the left side and large numbers with the right) will also be found in time and space. He calls this the SQUARC effect (Spatial Quantity Association of Response Codes).
