Kandel – Chapter 3
Day 9 Review: Genes and Behavior

1. Core Principle

Behavior is not inherited directly.
What is inherited is DNA.

Causal pathway:

DNA → RNA → Protein → Neural Circuits → Behavior

Genes encode proteins.
Proteins shape neural circuits.
Neural circuits generate behavior.

Behavior is therefore an indirect product of gene expression.

2. Gene–Environment Interaction

No behavior is purely genetic.
No behavior is purely environmental.

Phenotype = Genotype × Environment

Genes set biological potentials.
Environment determines how those potentials are expressed.

Key concept: Genetic influence is probabilistic, not deterministic.

3. What Is Actually Inherited?

Genotype: genetic constitution
Phenotype: observable traits (including behavioral tendencies)
Alleles: different versions of a gene
Homozygous: two identical alleles
Heterozygous: two different alleles
Behavior reflects the interaction between inherited alleles and environmental experience.

4. Mutations and Behavioral Effects

Types of mutations:

Missense → single amino acid substitution
Nonsense → premature stop codon
Frameshift → altered reading frame
Mutations may be:

Neutral
Harmful
Beneficial
Single-gene mutations can dramatically affect neural function, but most human behaviors are not monogenic.

5. Monogenic vs Polygenic Traits

Monogenic Traits

Caused by mutation in one gene
High penetrance
Clear inheritance pattern
Polygenic Traits

Influenced by many genes
Each gene contributes small effect
Strong environmental modulation
Most psychiatric and behavioral traits are polygenic or oligogenic.

6. Circadian Rhythm Genes

Circadian rhythms are controlled by transcription–translation feedback loops.

Mechanism:

Gene transcription
Protein translation
Protein accumulation
Nuclear entry
Inhibition of its own transcription
Protein degradation
Cycle restarts
This generates ~24-hour oscillations.

Key idea: The biological clock is a self-regulating molecular feedback system.

7. Genes Regulating Feeding Behavior

Certain genes regulate:

Appetite
Satiety
Energy balance
Mutation → excessive feeding
Hormone replacement → phenotype rescue

Important insight: Behavior can sometimes be modified even when genetic mutation remains.

8. Neurotransmitter Genes and Behavior

Genes affecting neurotransmitter systems influence:

Aggression
Impulsivity
Novelty seeking
Mood regulation
However:

Neurotransmitter–behavior relationships are nonlinear.

Behavior depends on neural circuit dynamics, not single molecules.

9. Twin Studies and Heritability

Monozygotic twins:

Share ~100% of genes
Dizygotic twins:

Share ~50% of genes
Higher concordance in monozygotic twins suggests genetic contribution.

Important clarification:

Heritability ≠ inevitability
Heritability estimates population-level variance, not individual destiny.

10. Penetrance and Anticipation

Incomplete penetrance: mutation does not always produce phenotype
Genetic anticipation: disease appears earlier or more severe in successive generations
These phenomena demonstrate that gene expression is probabilistic and modulated.

11. Big Integrative Model

Behavior emerges from dynamic interaction among:

Proteins

Environmental feedback

Genes influence behavior indirectly by shaping neural architecture and plasticity.

2-Minute Oral Summary

Genes do not encode behaviors directly; they encode proteins that shape neural circuits. Behavior is the output of those circuits interacting with environmental inputs. While some disorders result from single-gene mutations, most behavioral traits are polygenic and influenced by many genes of small effect. Twin studies show heritability, but heritability does not imply determinism. Ultimately, behavior reflects continuous interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental experience.

High-Yield Exam Triggers

Are behaviors inherited?
No. Genetic predispositions are inherited, not behaviors.

Why are psychiatric disorders polygenic?
Because they involve complex neural circuits regulated by many interacting genes.

Central dogma applied to behavior?
DNA → Protein → Neural circuitry → Behavioral output.

Role of environment?
Modulates gene expression and neural plasticity.
