## Day 1 – Nervous System Basics

Today I studied the basics of the nervous system from YOUYube course.
This topic was familiar to me, I studied in high school.

### What I learned:
- The nervous system has two main parts: Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
- The PNS is divided into afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) pathways
- The somatic nervous system controls voluntary movements
- The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions such as heart rate and breathing

### Neuron basics:
- A neuron consists of soma, dendrites, and an axon
- Dendrites receive signals and the axon transmits signals
- Types of neurons include multipolar, bipolar, and unipolar neurons

## Python - Day 1
## What I learned:
- What a program is and how Python executes commands line by line
- How to use the print() function to display output
- What variables  and that features are and how they store information
- That variable values can be changed during execution
- Python print the last variable

### Simple examples:
```python
name = "fatima"
print(name)

age = 32
print(age)

age = age + 1
print(age)
