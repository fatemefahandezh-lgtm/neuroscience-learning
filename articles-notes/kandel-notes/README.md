- Completed **Chapter 2** (Nerve Cells and Behavior)

### 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Structure of neurons (soma, dendrites, axon, synapse)
- Action potentials and membrane potential
- Synaptic transmission
- Reflex circuits (knee-jerk reflex)

# Kandel – Chapter 3  
## Day 9 Review: Genes and Behavior  

---

## 1. Core Principle

Behavior is **not inherited directly**.  
What is inherited is **DNA**.

**Causal pathway:**

DNA → RNA → Protein → Neural Circuits → Behavior

Genes encode proteins.  
Proteins shape neural circuits.  
Neural circuits generate behavior.

Behavior is therefore an indirect product of gene expression.

---

## 2. Gene–Environment Interaction

No behavior is purely genetic.  
No behavior is purely environmental.

**Phenotype = Genotype × Environment**

Genes set biological potentials.  
Environment determines how those potentials are expressed.

Key concept: Genetic influence is probabilistic, not deterministic.

---

## 3. What Is Actually Inherited?

- **Genotype**: genetic constitution  
- **Phenotype**: observable traits (including behavioral tendencies)  
- **Alleles**: different versions of a gene  
- **Homozygous**: two identical alleles  
- **Heterozygous**: two different alleles  

Behavior reflects the interaction between inherited alleles and environmental experience.

---

## 4. Mutations and Behavioral Effects

Types of mutations:

- Missense → single amino acid substitution  
- Nonsense → premature stop codon  
- Frameshift → altered reading frame  

Mutations may be:
- Neutral
- Harmful
- Beneficial

Single-gene mutations can dramatically affect neural function, but most human behaviors are not monogenic.

---

## 5. Monogenic vs Polygenic Traits

### Monogenic Traits
- Caused by mutation in one gene
- High penetrance
- Clear inheritance pattern

### Polygenic Traits
- Influenced by many genes
- Each gene contributes small effect
- Strong environmental modulation

Most psychiatric and behavioral traits are **polygenic or oligogenic**.

---

## 6. Circadian Rhythm Genes

Circadian rhythms are controlled by transcription–translation feedback loops.

Mechanism:

1. Gene transcription  
2. Protein translation  
3. Protein accumulation  
4. Nuclear entry  
5. Inhibition of its own transcription  
6. Protein degradation  
7. Cycle restarts  

This generates ~24-hour oscillations.

Key idea:
The biological clock is a self-regulating molecular feedback system.

---

## 7. Genes Regulating Feeding Behavior

Certain genes regulate:

- Appetite
- Satiety
- Energy balance

Mutation → excessive feeding  
Hormone replacement → phenotype rescue  

Important insight:
Behavior can sometimes be modified even when genetic mutation remains.

---

## 8. Neurotransmitter Genes and Behavior

Genes affecting neurotransmitter systems influence:

- Aggression
- Impulsivity
- Novelty seeking
- Mood regulation

However:

Neurotransmitter–behavior relationships are nonlinear.

Behavior depends on neural circuit dynamics, not single molecules.

---

## 9. Twin Studies and Heritability

Monozygotic twins:
- Share ~100% of genes

Dizygotic twins:
- Share ~50% of genes

Higher concordance in monozygotic twins suggests genetic contribution.

Important clarification:

Heritability ≠ inevitability  
Heritability estimates population-level variance, not individual destiny.

---

## 10. Penetrance and Anticipation

- **Incomplete penetrance**: mutation does not always produce phenotype  
- **Genetic anticipation**: disease appears earlier or more severe in successive generations  

These phenomena demonstrate that gene expression is probabilistic and modulated.

---

## 11. Big Integrative Model

Behavior emerges from dynamic interaction among:

Genes  
↓  
Proteins  
↓  
Neural circuits  
↓  
Behavior  
↓  
Environmental feedback  

Genes influence behavior indirectly by shaping neural architecture and plasticity.

---

## 2-Minute Oral Summary

Genes do not encode behaviors directly; they encode proteins that shape neural circuits. Behavior is the output of those circuits interacting with environmental inputs. While some disorders result from single-gene mutations, most behavioral traits are polygenic and influenced by many genes of small effect. Twin studies show heritability, but heritability does not imply determinism. Ultimately, behavior reflects continuous interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental experience.

---

## High-Yield Exam Triggers

**Are behaviors inherited?**  
No. Genetic predispositions are inherited, not behaviors.

**Why are psychiatric disorders polygenic?**  
Because they involve complex neural circuits regulated by many interacting genes.

**Central dogma applied to behavior?**  
DNA → Protein → Neural circuitry → Behavioral output.

**Role of environment?**  
Modulates gene expression and neural plasticity.
