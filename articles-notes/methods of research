Comprehensive Summary: The Scientific Revision Process
1. Submission (The Author) The author submits the manuscript along with all experimental data to the Editor for consideration.
2. Editorial Screening (The Editor) The Editor performs a quality control check based on ethical, financial, and formal standards. They may request additional data from the author at this stage.
3. Selecting Reviewers (The Editor) The Editor selects experts (internal or external) and assigns them the responsibility of the Peer Review process.
4. Peer Review Analysis (The Reviewer) The Reviewer analyzes the paper and decides whether to:
• Accept the article.
• Request Major or Minor Revisions.
• Reject the article.
5. Final Revisions (The Author) The Author makes the specific changes and corrections requested by the reviewers to improve the article.
6. Online Publication (The Editor) Once the revisions are approved, the Editor officially publishes the article online.
Post-Publication Impact (The Final Stage)
After publication, the article is subjected to the judgment of the Scientific Community. Its success and quality are evaluated based on:
• Citations: How many other researchers refer to the work.
• Downloads: How many times the paper is accessed.
• Social/Blog Coverage: Discussion in scientific blogs and media.
• Ex-post Notes: Follow-up comments or formal notes after the paper is live.
Exam Focus: Pay attention to the distinction between the Editor (who manages the process and makes the final call) and the Reviewer (who provides the technical critique).
