This document explains Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS), focusing primarily on a technique called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).
What is TMS?
TMS is a way to stimulate specific parts of the brain without surgery. It uses a device called a coil placed on the head to create a quick magnetic field. This magnetic field passes through the scalp and creates a small electric current in the brain, which makes the brain cells (neurons) fire.
Key Concepts
 * Historical Background: The modern version was introduced by Barker in 1984, showing that stimulating the motor area of the brain could make a person's fingers move.
 * Precision: TMS has very high temporal resolution, meaning it can target the brain at the exact millisecond a thought or movement happens. Its spatial resolution (how specific the area is) depends on the coil shape; a "figure-8" coil is very focused, while a circular coil stimulates a larger area.
 * Measuring Results: Scientists can see if TMS is working by watching for muscle twitches (called MEPs), changes in behavior, or by using brain scans like MRI and EEG.
How It Is Used
 * Research: To understand which parts of the brain control things like math, emotions, or recognizing faces.
 * "Virtual Lesions": By temporarily interfering with a brain area during a task, researchers can prove that a specific part of the brain is necessary for that task.
 * Clinical Treatment: It is used to treat Depression (by stimulating areas that process emotions) and to help with Stroke recovery.
Benefits and Risks
 * Pros: It is low-cost, non-invasive, and allows doctors to see a direct link between brain activity and behavior.
 * Cons/Risks: It can sometimes be noisy or cause a tingling sensation on the skin. At very high frequencies, it could potentially cause a seizure, so patients must be screened carefully first.
Safety Screening
Before using TMS, people must answer a questionnaire to ensure they don't have metal implants (like pacemakers), a history of epilepsy, or other conditions that might make the procedure unsafe [cite: 29-48].
Summary
In short, TMS is a powerful tool that uses magnets to "talk" to the brain. [cite_start]It helps scientists map how the brain works and helps doctors treat brain-related illnesses by encouraging the brain to change and heal (neuroplasticity).
