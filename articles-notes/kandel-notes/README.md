# Day 7 – Kandel (Chapter 1)

## Topic
Introduction to major parts of the nervous system and their basic functions.

## Main focus
Reading and familiarization (no deep memorization yet).

## Key structures reviewed

### Spinal cord
- Main pathway for sensory input and motor output.
- Responsible for basic reflexes.

### Medulla oblongata
- Controls vital autonomic functions.
- Breathing, heart rate, and basic survival mechanisms.

### Cerebellum
- Coordination of movement.
- Balance, timing, and motor learning.

### Brainstem (overview)
- Connects spinal cord to higher brain areas.
- Essential for life-sustaining functions.

### Cerebral cortex (introductory view)
- Higher cognitive functions.
- Sensory processing, motor planning, and integration.

## Study note
- Focused on understanding the general role of each structure.
- Detailed mechanisms and pathways will be reviewed in later days.

- ## Day 8 – Review & Progress

### 📚 Study Summary
- Reviewed **Chapter 1** (Functional localization & core principles of neural science)
- Completed **Chapter 2** (Nerve Cells and Behavior)

### 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Structure of neurons (soma, dendrites, axon, synapse)
- Action potentials and membrane potential
- Synaptic transmission
- Reflex circuits (knee-jerk reflex)
- Neural networks and divergence/convergence
- Neural plasticity and its role in behavior

### 🎯 Main Insight
Behavior emerges from **networks of neurons**, not single cells.  
Brain plasticity allows modification of neural connections, enabling learning and partial recovery after injury.
