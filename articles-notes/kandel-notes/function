# 1. The Neurobiology of Behavior

## From Cave Paintings to Cognition

The handprint in Chauvet Cave (~30,000 years old) represents one of the earliest human signatures.

This symbolic act reflects:

- Self-awareness
- Intentional representation
- Abstract cognition

Neural science asks:

How does the brain generate such mental processes?

## The Core Questions of Neural Science

Neural science attempts to answer:

1. How do we perceive, act, learn, and remember?
2. Are mental functions localized or distributed?
3. Can complex behavior be explained by studying single neurons?
4. How do genes influence behavior?
5. How does experience reshape neural circuits?

Central challenge:

Link molecules → cells → circuits → behavior → mind

---

## Localization vs Emergence

Two key frameworks:

- Localization: specific mental functions reside in defined brain regions.
- Emergent properties: mental processes arise from distributed network interactions.

Modern view:
Mental functions are regionally specialized but network-dependent.

---

## Linking Molecules to Mind

Modern neuroscience connects:

- Ion channels
- Synaptic proteins
- Gene expression
- Neural circuitry
- Brain imaging
- Observable behavior

New imaging methods allow identification of active brain regions during thinking and feeling.

---

## Genes and Behavior

Behavior is not inherited.

DNA is inherited.

Genes encode proteins that:

- Shape neural circuits
- Regulate synaptic transmission
- Enable plasticity

Environment modifies gene expression beginning in utero.

Thus:

Behavior = Genetic architecture × Experience

---

## Synaptic Specificity

One major principle:

Specific synaptic connections formed during development underlie:

- Perception
- Action
- Emotion
- Learning

---

# 2. Cytology of Neurons

## General Structural Plan

All neurons share four compartments:

1. Dendrites – receive input
2. Cell body (soma) – gene expression & protein synthesis
3. Axon – signal conduction
4. Terminals – neurotransmitter release

Neurons are:

- Highly polarized
- Electrically excitable
- Structurally compartmentalized

---

## Polarization

Neurons resemble epithelial cells in polarity:

- Basolateral surface → dendritic origin
- Apical surface → axonal origin

Functional boundary:
Axon hillock = trigger zone for action potentials

---

## Excitability

Electrical signaling depends on:

- Ion channels
- Ion pumps
- Membrane polarization

Unlike most cells, neurons specialize in:

- Rapid signal propagation
- Long-distance communication

---

# 3. Intracellular Organization

## Cytosol

Contains:

- Metabolic enzymes
- Neurotransmitter synthesis enzymes
- Signaling proteins

Some proteins are neuron-specific.

---

## Membranous Organelles

Vacuolar system includes:

- Rough ER (protein synthesis)
- Smooth ER (Ca²⁺ storage, lipid metabolism)
- Golgi apparatus
- Vesicles
- Endosomes
- Lysosomes

Pathways:

Secretory pathway:
ER → Golgi → Vesicle → Exocytosis

Endocytic pathway:
Membrane → Endosome → Recycling or degradation

---

## Mitochondria

- Produce ATP
- Support high metabolic demand

Neurons are energetically expensive cells.

---

# 4. Cytoskeleton

Accounts for ~25% of neuronal protein.

## Microtubules (25 nm)

- Made of α- and β-tubulin
- Polar structures (+ and – ends)
- Provide structural support
- Serve as transport tracks
- Stabilized by MAPs (MAP2 in dendrites, tau in axons)

---

## Neurofilaments (10 nm)

- Provide mechanical strength
- Highly stable
- Abundant in axons
- Form neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease

---

## Actin Microfilaments (3–5 nm)

- Dynamic
- Concentrated near membrane
- Important for:
  - Growth cones
  - Spine formation
  - Synaptic plasticity

Dynamic cytoskeleton allows:

- Process extension
- Retraction
- Structural remodeling

---

# 5. Sensory vs Motor Neurons (Stretch Reflex)

## Sensory Neuron

- Cell body in dorsal root ganglion
- Single axon that bifurcates
- Myelinated
- Conduction ~80 m/s
- Releases glutamate

Function:
Transmit peripheral stretch information to spinal cord.

---

## Motor Neuron

- Located in ventral horn
- Extensive dendritic tree
- Single large axon
- Uses acetylcholine

Function:
Integrates many inputs and contracts muscle.

Key difference:

Sensory neuron = information transmitter  
Motor neuron = integrative decision unit

---

# 6. Pyramidal Neurons (Hippocampus)

- Located in CA1 and CA3 regions
- Two dendritic trees (basal and apical)
- Thousands of synaptic inputs
- Use glutamate

Dendritic spines:

- Thin
- Mushroom
- Stubby
- Branched

Spines act as biochemical compartments.

Critical for:

Learning and memory plasticity.

---

# 7. Myelin and Conduction

Myelin:

- 70% lipid
- 30% protein
- Speeds conduction via saltatory transmission

Peripheral myelin:
Schwann cells

Central myelin:
Oligodendrocytes

Nodes of Ranvier:
Sites of action potential regeneration

---

## Clinical Insight

Defective myelin → conduction failure

Examples:

- Multiple sclerosis
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
- Genetic myelin protein mutations

Myelin integrity is essential for neural circuit function.

---

# 8. Big Integrative Model

Neurons are:

- Molecular machines
- Electrically excitable units
- Structurally polarized cells
- Network-integrated processors

Mind emerges from:

Molecules  
→ Organelles  
→ Neurons  
→ Circuits  
→ Systems  
→ Behavior  

---

# 2-Minute Oral Summary

Neural science seeks to understand how mental processes arise from the brain. Neurons are highly polarized, excitable cells organized into dendrites, soma, axons, and terminals. Their function depends on ion channels, synaptic specificity, and cytoskeletal organization. Sensory neurons transmit information, motor neurons integrate and execute commands, and pyramidal neurons enable complex cognition and memory. Myelination ensures rapid conduction, and defects in myelin disrupt neural communication. Ultimately, behavior emerges from molecular processes organized into neural circuits.
