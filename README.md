## Day 1 – Nervous System Basics

Today I studied the basics of the nervous system from YOUYube course.
This topic was familiar to me, I studied in high school.

### What I learned:
- The nervous system has two main parts: Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
- The PNS is divided into afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) pathways
- The somatic nervous system controls voluntary movements
- The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions such as heart rate and breathing

### Neuron basics:
- A neuron consists of soma, dendrites, and an axon
- Dendrites receive signals and the axon transmits signals
- Types of neurons include multipolar, bipolar, and unipolar neurons

## Python - Day 1
## What I learned:
- What a program is and how Python executes commands line by line
- How to use the print() function to display output
- What variables  and that features are and how they store information
- That variable values can be changed during execution
- Python print the last variable

Simple examples:
###python
name = "fatima"
print(name)

age = 32
print(age)

age = age + 1
print(age)

## Neuroscience – Day 2

### Topics:
- Electrical properties of neurons
- Resting potential, depolarization, repolarization, and hyperpolarization
- Action potential
- Myelinated axons and saltatory conduction
- Refractory period

### My understanding:
Neurons have a resting potential of about -70 mV. When sodium channels open, the neuron depolarizes and can reach about +40 mV during an action potential. After that, repolarization and hyperpolarization occur. Myelinated axons transmit signals faster through nodes of Ranvier using saltatory conduction. The refractory period is a time when the neuron cannot fire again, even if the stimulus is strong.
## Python – Day 2
- Reviewed variables and print
- Learned input()
- Understood difference between input and variable
- Learned that input returns string

- ## Neuroscience – Day 3
- Studied neuron structure in detail:
  - Soma (cell body), nucleus, cytoplasm
  - Mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes
- Reviewed functions of dendrites and axon
- Learned about glial cells and their roles:
  - Astrocytes (support, metabolism, BBB)
  - Oligodendrocytes (myelination in CNS)
  - Schwann cells (myelination in PNS)
  - Microglia (immune defense)
- Understood differences between glial cells in CNS vs PNS
- 
## Python – Day 3
- Learned conditional statements:
  - if
  - else
  - elif
- Understood how Python makes decisions based on conditions
- Practiced using comparison operators (>, <, >=, ==)
- Learned basic loops (for / concept of repetition)
- Faced and fixed common errors related to indentation and syntax
