This document, titled "The Application of Metaverse in Neuroscience and Clinical Psychology" by Chiara Lucifora, explains how virtual reality (VR) and related technologies are used to study the human brain and treat mental health issues.
Here is a breakdown of the key points in simple terms:
1. What is Virtual Reality (VR)?
 * Definition: VR is a computer-made world that feels real. It uses 3D graphics and sound to make you feel like you are actually "there".
 * Types of VR:
   * Non-immersive: Using a computer screen and a joystick.
   * Semi-immersive: Projecting images onto the walls of a room.
   * Immersive: Wearing a headset that blocks out the real world.
 * Extended Reality (XR): This is an "umbrella term" that includes VR, Augmented Reality (AR—where digital objects are layered over the real world), and Mixed Reality (MR).
2. How VR Affects the Brain and Body
 * The "Filling-In" Mechanism: The brain doesn't need a perfect picture to believe a virtual room is real; it uses "filling-in" to guess the rest based on what we already know about rooms.
 * The Uncanny Valley: If a robot or digital character looks almost human but not quite, it makes people feel uncomfortable or creeped out.
 * Physical Response: Even though the world is fake, the body reacts as if it is real, with changes in heart rate or sweating.
 * Body Ownership (Virtual Embodiment): The brain is flexible. It can quickly start to believe that a virtual body is its own body.
   * Proteus Effect: Wearing a specific virtual avatar can change how you act; for example, wearing an Einstein avatar can help you do better on brain tasks.
3. VR in Scientific Research
VR allows scientists to study dangerous or impossible situations safely:
 * Moral Dilemmas: Researchers use VR to see how people react in "life or death" situations, like the "Trolley Dilemma" (choosing who to save in a train accident).
   * Studies showed that people from different countries (like Italy and Switzerland) make different moral choices.
 * Weapon Focus Effect: This is when a witness to a crime focuses so much on a weapon that they forget the criminal's face. VR helps scientists study this without putting people in actual danger.
4. VR in Clinical Psychology (Cyber Therapy)
VR is becoming a popular tool to help treat various disorders:
 * Exposure Therapy: Patients are slowly and safely exposed to their fears in VR to learn that they are not in danger.
 * Phobias Treated:
   * Social Phobia: Fear of being judged by others.
   * Glossophobia: Fear of public speaking (VR can simulate a friendly or bored audience).
   * Arachnophobia: Fear of spiders.
   * Acrophobia: Fear of heights.
 * PTSD: Helping people process traumatic memories, such as those from car accidents.
5. Side Effects
 * Motion Sickness: Sometimes called "cyber-sickness," this happens when your eyes see movement but your body feels still. Symptoms include nausea, dizziness, and headaches.
