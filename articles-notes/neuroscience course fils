## Day 10 – Research Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience

Today I studied the main experimental methods used to investigate behavior and its neural correlates in cognitive neuroscience.

### Neuroimaging Techniques
- **fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**  
  Measures brain activity indirectly via blood oxygenation (BOLD signal).  
  High spatial resolution, low temporal resolution.
- **PET (Positron Emission Tomography)**  
  Uses radioactive tracers to measure metabolic and neurochemical activity.  
  Invasive, with low temporal resolution.

### Electrophysiological Methods
- **EEG / MEG**  
  Record electrical or magnetic brain activity from the scalp.  
  High temporal resolution, limited spatial precision.
- **EMG (Electromyography)**  
  Measures muscle activity and is useful for studying emotional and motor responses.

### Psychophysiology
- Measures physiological consequences of cognitive and emotional processes:
  - ECG (heart activity)
  - EDA (skin conductance)
  - EMG (muscle activation)
- Provides indirect indices of neural activity.

### Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation
- **TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation)**  
  Used to stimulate or temporarily disrupt specific brain areas to study causal brain–behavior relationships.
- **tES (e.g., tDCS)**  
  Modulates cortical excitability using weak electrical currents.

### Additional Research Approaches
- **Patient studies:** Effects of brain lesions on cognition and behavior.
- **Animal models:** Controlled investigation of neural mechanisms.
- **Pharmacological manipulations:** Effects of drugs and hormones on brain and behavior.

### Key Takeaway
Each method has limitations, but combining multiple approaches provides a more complete understanding of how brain activity gives rise to behavior.
