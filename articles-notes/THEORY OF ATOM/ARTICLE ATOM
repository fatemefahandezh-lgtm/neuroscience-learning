# Notes on ATOM Theory and Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT)

## ATOM: A Theory of Magnitude (Walsh)

Walsh’s **ATOM (A Theory Of Magnitude)** proposes that the human brain relies on a **shared neural system** to process different measurable magnitudes. These magnitudes include:

- Space (distance, location)
- Time (duration, temporal intervals)
- Number
- Size, intensity, and other quantitative dimensions

Rather than being handled by fully independent and modular systems, these magnitudes are processed by an **overlapping neural network**, primarily involving the **parietal cortex**, especially the **intraparietal sulcus (IPS)**.

Importantly, ATOM does not claim that a single, isolated brain region performs all magnitude-related computations. Instead, it suggests the existence of a **common magnitude-processing hub or network** that supports multiple quantitative domains.

Biological and behavioral evidence for ATOM includes:
- Shared deficits in spatial, temporal, and numerical processing following parietal cortex damage
- Interference effects between time, space, and number judgments
- Transfer effects, where training in one magnitude domain influences performance in another

## Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) and Time

**Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT)** argues that abstract concepts are understood through more concrete, embodied domains. In the case of **time**, human cognition heavily relies on **spatial representations**.

Examples include common spatial metaphors for time such as:
- “Looking forward to the future”
- “Falling behind schedule”
- “A long period of time”

CMT does **not** claim that time is literally identical to space. Instead, it proposes that **time is cognitively represented and structured using spatial processing mechanisms and metaphors**.

## Relation Between ATOM and CMT

ATOM and CMT operate at different explanatory levels but are **complementary**:

- **ATOM** provides a neural-level account, suggesting that time and space share common processing resources in the brain.
- **CMT** provides a cognitive-level account, explaining why temporal concepts are systematically structured using spatial representations.

Together, these frameworks support the idea that the close relationship between time and space is reflected both in **brain mechanisms** and in **conceptual structure**, without implying that time and space are ontologically identical.

## Key Clarification

Shared neural processing or shared representation **does not imply** that time and space are the same entity. It indicates a **common coding and processing strategy** used by the brain for handling measurable magnitudes.
