The document "The application of Metaverse in Neuroscience and Clinical psychology" by Chiara Lucifora explains how technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are used to study the human brain and treat mental health issues.
1. What are these technologies?
 * Virtual Reality (VR): A digital world that makes you feel like you are physically present in a different place. It uses headsets to block out the real world and provide visual and sound feedback.
 * Augmented Reality (AR): Instead of replacing the real world, AR adds digital objects to it (like seeing a digital image through a smartphone or special glasses).
 * Extended Reality (XR): This is an "umbrella term" that covers VR, AR, and Mixed Reality.
2. How our brain reacts to VR
 * The "Filling-In" Mechanism: Our brains don't need a perfect digital world to believe it is real. If the VR gives enough "clues" (like the basic shape of a room), our brain uses its internal memories to fill in the rest.
 * Presence: This is the "illusory sensation" of truly being there. Because the brain believes the environment is real, your body reacts physically—your heart rate might go up, or your skin might sweat.
 * The Uncanny Valley: If a digital character looks almost human but not quite right, it makes people feel uncomfortable or creeped out.
 * Virtual Embodiment: Our brains are flexible. If you see a virtual body moving exactly like yours in VR, your brain can start to "own" that body. This can even change your behavior; for example, people wearing a virtual "Einstein" body performed better on cognitive tasks.
3. Use in Scientific Research
Researchers use VR to study things that would be too dangerous or impossible to test in real life:
 * Moral Dilemmas: Scientists use the "Trolley Dilemma" to see if people would pull a lever to save five people by killing one. VR allows researchers to see the difference between what people say they would do (Cold Task) and how they actually behave in a split-second emergency (Hot Task).
 * Weapon Focus Effect: This is the tendency for crime witnesses to remember the weapon but forget the criminal's face. VR helps study this safely by simulating a crime scene and tracking the witness's reactions.
4. Use in Clinical Psychology (Cyber-therapy)
VR is a powerful tool for therapy because it allows patients to face their fears in a safe, controlled environment:
 * Phobias: It is used to treat the fear of public speaking (by practicing in front of a virtual audience), fear of heights (acrophobia), and fear of spiders (arachnophobia).
 * PTSD: For people who have survived trauma (like a car accident), VR can slowly re-expose them to those memories to help them process the fear.
 * Addiction and Eating Disorders: VR can also be used to understand and treat these conditions.
5. Side Effects
The most common problem is Motion Sickness (also called cyber-sickness). This happens when your eyes see movement in the VR headset, but your body feels like it is standing still. This can cause nausea, dizziness, or headaches.
