This review article explores how our ability to track time is connected to interoception (the way we feel signals from inside our bodies, like a heartbeat or hunger) and the activity of the insular cortex (a brain region that processes these internal feelings).
Key Concepts in Simple Words
 * Time Processing: This is a complex skill that uses many parts of the brain to manage daily life. It includes:
   * Prospective vs. Retrospective: Knowing you are timing something in advance versus estimating time after something has already happened.
   * Motor vs. Perceptual: Physically moving to show time (like tapping a finger) versus comparing the lengths of two different sounds or sights.
   * Perception vs. Representation: Experiencing time as it happens versus remembering time or predicting how long something will take in the future.
 * Interoception: This is your "inner sense" that lets you feel what is happening inside your body.
 * The Insula: This is the part of the brain that acts like a decoder for those internal body signals.
How Clinical Disorders Affect Time
The researchers looked at several mental and neurological health conditions to see if their timing problems were linked to how they feel their bodies:
 * Overestimating Time (Feeling like time is slow):
   * Schizophrenia: Patients often feel time is longer than it really is, which may be linked to how they process internal body signals.
   * Depression & Anxiety: People with these conditions often feel time drags slowly. This is matched by increased activity in the insula.
   * Tourette's Syndrome & Migraines: Both are linked to overestimating time and higher activity in the insula.
 * Underestimating Time (Feeling like time is fast):
   * ADHD & Autism: These disorders are often associated with underestimating long periods of time and lower activity in the insula.
   * Parkinson’s Disease & Essential Tremor: Patients with these movement disorders tend to underestimate time and show less activity in the insula brain region.
Conclusion
The study suggests that when someone has a mental or brain disorder that changes how they perceive time, it is often because their "internal body clock" and the brain's insula are not working normally. Basically, how we feel our bodies on the inside directly affects how we experience the world's time on the outside.
