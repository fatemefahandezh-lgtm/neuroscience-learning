## Day 1 – Nervous System Basics

Today I studied the basics of the nervous system from YOUYube course.
This topic was familiar to me, I studied in high school.

### What I learned:
- The nervous system has two main parts: Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
- The PNS is divided into afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) pathways
- The somatic nervous system controls voluntary movements
- The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions such as heart rate and breathing

### Neuron basics:
- A neuron consists of soma, dendrites, and an axon
- Dendrites receive signals and the axon transmits signals
- Types of neurons include multipolar, bipolar, and unipolar neurons

## Python - Day 1
## What I learned:
- What a program is and how Python executes commands line by line
- How to use the print() function to display output
- What variables  and that features are and how they store information
- That variable values can be changed during execution
- Python print the last variable

Simple examples:
###python
name = "fatima"
print(name)

age = 32
print(age)

age = age + 1
print(age)

## Neuroscience – Day 2

### Topics:
- Electrical properties of neurons
- Resting potential, depolarization, repolarization, and hyperpolarization
- Action potential
- Myelinated axons and saltatory conduction
- Refractory period

### My understanding:
Neurons have a resting potential of about -70 mV. When sodium channels open, the neuron depolarizes and can reach about +40 mV during an action potential. After that, repolarization and hyperpolarization occur. Myelinated axons transmit signals faster through nodes of Ranvier using saltatory conduction. The refractory period is a time when the neuron cannot fire again, even if the stimulus is strong.
## Python – Day 2
- Reviewed variables and print
- Learned input()
- Understood difference between input and variable
- Learned that input returns string

- ## Neuroscience – Day 3
- Studied neuron structure in detail:
  - Soma (cell body), nucleus, cytoplasm
  - Mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes
- Reviewed functions of dendrites and axon
- Learned about glial cells and their roles:
  - Astrocytes (support, metabolism, BBB)
  - Oligodendrocytes (myelination in CNS)
  - Schwann cells (myelination in PNS)
  - Microglia (immune defense)
- Understood differences between glial cells in CNS vs PNS
- 
## Python – Day 3
- Learned conditional statements:
  - if
  - else
  - elif
- Understood how Python makes decisions based on conditions
- Practiced using comparison operators (>, <, >=, ==)
- Learned basic loops (for / concept of repetition)
- Faced and fixed common errors related to indentation and syntax

## Neuroscience – Day 4
- Studied synaptic communication between neurons
- Learned the structure and function of synapses
- Understood the difference between electrical and chemical synapses
- Focused on how neural signals are transmitted across the synaptic cleft
- Learned about excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP and IPSP)
- Understood how neurons integrate multiple EPSP and IPSP signals to decide whether to fire an action potential
- Learned how experience and repetition reshape neural connections
- Understood neuroplasticity as a functional change, not just structural
- Connected plasticity to synaptic strengthening and weakening

## Day 4 – Python (Basics + Mini Cognitive Task)

Today I practiced Python basics through a small interactive program.

### Concepts I worked on:
- `print()` for output
- `input()` for user interaction
- Variables and data types
- `int()` for type conversion
- `if / else` conditional logic
- `for` loop
- Measuring time using `time.time()`
- Lists (`append`) to store data

### What I built:
- A simple loop-based task that asks the user a yes/no question
- Measured reaction time for each answer
- Stored user answers in a list
- Stored reaction times in a separate list
- Calculated a final score based on correct answers

This was my first step toward building simple cognitive experiments using Python.

## Day 5 – Neuroscience (Review & Consolidation)

Today I focused on reviewing and consolidating core neuroscience concepts.

### Topics reviewed:
- Structure of the nervous system (CNS vs PNS)
- Afferent and efferent pathways
- Neuron structure (soma, dendrites, axon)
- Types of neurons (multipolar, bipolar, unipolar)
- Glial cells and their functions
- Resting membrane potential
- Action potential (depolarization, repolarization, hyperpolarization)
- Myelination and saltatory conduction
- Refractory period
- EPSP and IPSP (basic synaptic integration)
The goal of today was to strengthen foundational understanding before moving forward.
- Synapse structure (presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons)
- Basic synaptic transmission mechanisms

## Day 6 – Neuroscience (From Action Potential to Brain Signals)

Today I studied advanced concepts related to action potential generation, propagation, and their relationship to brain-level signals.

### Topics covered:
- Axon hillock and spike-triggering zone
- Refractory period and its functional role
- Nodes of Ranvier and saltatory conduction
- Myelination and its disruption in Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
- Neural oscillations and their functional significance
- Basics of EEG and what it measures
- Introduction to the Hodgkin–Huxley dynamic model of action potential

This session helped me connect single-neuron electrophysiology to large-scale brain activity.

# Day 7 – Kandel (Chapter 1)

## Topic
Introduction to major parts of the nervous system and their basic functions.

## Main focus
Reading and familiarization (no deep memorization yet).

## Key structures reviewed

### Spinal cord
- Main pathway for sensory input and motor output.
- Responsible for basic reflexes.

### Medulla oblongata
- Controls vital autonomic functions.
- Breathing, heart rate, and basic survival mechanisms.

### Cerebellum
- Coordination of movement.
- Balance, timing, and motor learning.

### Brainstem (overview)
- Connects spinal cord to higher brain areas.
- Essential for life-sustaining functions.

### Cerebral cortex (introductory view)
- Higher cognitive functions.
- Sensory processing, motor planning, and integration.

## Study note
- Focused on understanding the general role of each structure.
- Detailed mechanisms and pathways will be reviewed in later days.
