# VR as More Than a Gadget – Vicario et al.

## Paper Focus
This paper argues that VR should not be seen only as a technological gadget,
but as a multidisciplinary tool with cognitive, psychological, and educational implications.

## Key Domains Discussed
- Psychology and cognition
- Spatial perception and geography
- Language learning
- Art education
- Embodied experience

## Core Insight
VR creates immersive experiences that actively reshape perception, learning,
and interaction with environments, rather than passively delivering content.

## Why This Matters for Cognitive Science
This perspective connects VR with neuroplasticity, embodiment, and learning processes,
making it relevant beyond technology studies.

## Personal Note
This paper changed my view of VR from a tool to an experiential cognitive environment.
